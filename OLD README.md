# Portfolio-Update

## Desciption
Create a updated portfolio page using more advanced technologies.

## Goals
This application is an update of an older assignment, designed to showcase the work of a web developer. 

This site has 5 sections:
* A Landing Page - a starting spot with an enter button.
* A Navigation Page - with buttons to the following three pages:
    * Portfolio
    * About Me
    * Contact

Currently the page is an MVP, designed to showcase the layout/design of the webpage. A future update would include content.

## Technologies Used
My site is powered by the following technologies:
* Materialize HTML/CSS
* AOS Library
* Google Fonts
* Materialize Icons
* JQuery

## Complications

**Developing A Grid Framework** - This took almost all of my time. Figuring out how to set up my page so that it could incorperate the vertical and horizontal scrolling was very time consuming. Having each part of the grid as a full-screen div was a challange in itself.

## Future Improvements
Because of the layout of the site, it is designed to be navigated only with button clicks at the moment. In the future, I want to remove the scroll bar, and add event listeners to the scrolling, so they would have the same effects as the button clicks.

Because I spent most of my time working out the framework of the site, it is lacking visually. I would like to remove the block colors and add pictures/designs to the site. 

Also, content would need to be added, including a portfolio showcase, a form for a contact page, and a desciptive "about me" section.
