# profile-2.0


## Desciption
Second version of my personal profile page.

## Goals
This application is an update of an older assignment, designed to showcase my work as a web developer. 

This site has 5 sections:
* A Landing Page - a starting spot with an enter button which leads to the navigation page.
* A Navigation Page - with buttons to the following three pages:
    * Portfolio
    * About Me
    * Contact

The design of the site is influenced by my previous career in music and took some inspiration from one of my favorite pieces of music: [Enigma Variations by Edward Elgar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_Variations).

In this piece, Elgar takes one musical theme and transforms it over several variations. Each variation differs in style, but the theme remains in all of them.

Like the Enigma Variations, I decided to make my personal profile reflect my main theme (music), but create variations to make it more interesting. Each section of the website will have a specific musical variation (the landing page reflects music in the 80s, the portfolio is a minimilistic representation of an orchestra, etc.)

Hopefully this will allow future employers to see that I am capable of designing in varying styles and gives other users a fun experience. 



## Technologies Used
My site is powered by the following technologies:
* Materialize HTML/CSS
* AOS Library
* Google Fonts
* Materialize Icons
* JQuery
* CSS Animations

## Features Added

**Developing Improved Visuals** - My last portfolio update was basically focused on creating a 3x3 grid of full-page divs. I wanted to include more of my personality and passions into my portfolio this time. I updated the visuals with a custom-made boombox landing page, complete with a shaking animation and tape playing on a button click. Also included a navigation page using piano keys, and portfolio, About Me, and Contact pages with a full-screen video background. 

**Navigaing** - I was able to remove the scroll bar from the page and now the only way to navigate is by clicking on links/buttons. In the future, I want to and add event listeners to the scrolling, so they would have the same effects as the button clicks.


## Future Improvements

**Content** - More content still needs to be added, including more items in the portfolio, an improved form for a contact page, and a desciptive "about me" section.

**Scaling for Mobile** - I'm still not sure how to take this design to mobile. I'm assuming it has to be totally redesigned for a smaller screen.

**Audio** - It seems appropriate that the page would have some music. My goal would be to write a short, loopable piece of music (30 seconds max), that would be played while the listener was on the site. Ultimately, I would like the genre of the music to change when the user changes sections of the site.
