# profile-2.0


## Desciption
Second version of my personal profile page.

## Goals
This application is an update of an older assignment, designed to showcase the work of a web developer. 

This site has 5 sections:
* A Landing Page - a starting spot with an enter button which leads to the navigation page.
* A Navigation Page - with buttons to the following three pages:
    * Portfolio
    * About Me
    * Contact

Currently the page is an MVP, designed to showcase the layout/design of the webpage. A future update would include content.

## Technologies Used
My site is powered by the following technologies:
* Materialize HTML/CSS
* AOS Library
* Google Fonts
* Materialize Icons
* JQuery
* CSS Animations
* Pixabay Videos

## Features Added

**Developing Improved Visuals** - My last portfolio update was basically focused on creating a 3x3 grid of full-page divs. I wanted to include more of my personality and passions into my portfolio this time. I updated the visuals with a custom-made boombox landing page, complete with a shaking animation and tape playing on a button click. Also included a navigation page using piano keys, and portfolio, About Me, and Contact pages with a full-screen video background. 

**Navigaing** - I was able to remove the scroll bar from the page and now the only way to navigate is by clicking on links/buttons. In the future, I want to and add event listeners to the scrolling, so they would have the same effects as the button clicks.

## Future Improvements

* The content still needs to be added, including a portfolio showcase, a form for a contact page, and a desciptive "about me" section.

* I'm also trying to figure out how to add multiple Pixabay videos to my site, but haven't been able to do it so far.

* I'm considering also switching to CSS grid, but it might be too complicated with my current 3x3 full-page div setup.

* Scaling for Mobile: I'm still not sure how to take this design to mobile. I'm assuming it has to be totally redesigned for a smaller screen.

* For some reason, when I refresh the page, it won't go back to my first section.
